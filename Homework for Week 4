The basic concepts of CFT

Control flow testing (CFT) is a direct and natural extension to coverage-based FSM testing
with a specialized type of FSMs called control flow graphs (CFGs) and with a focus on
complete execution paths instead of on state or link coverage.

The basic idea for control flow testing (CFT) is to select paths as test cases and sensitize
them by assigning corresponding input values.
